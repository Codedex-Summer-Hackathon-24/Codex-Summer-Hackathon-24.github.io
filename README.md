### Track 1: Board Game Cafe Website
Sip & Play is a vibrant board game café located in NYC. Our task was to design a brand-new website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.js, or A-frame. The website needed to include an events calendar, an approachable UI/UX design, a 3D menu, and be mobile-friendly, SEO-friendly, and creative. Given the high likelihood of mobile users, we focused significantly on the UI/UX experience, particularly for mobile devices.


## UI/UX

We streamlined the website for better usability, ensuring that information is displayed effectively on small screens while maintaining an appealing design.

The home page was redesigned to clearly convey what Sip & Play is all about. We placed the description and reservation link at the top, highlighted games and events, and emphasized Magic: The Gathering.

To make the website mobile-friendly and interactive, we used a carousel to showcase highlighted games and events. Additionally, we consolidated pages by grouping all "play"-related content into one section and moved the press/news area to the bottom of the "About Us" section to highlight the café.

## 3D Menu

Creating the 3D menu was a particularly challenging part of the project. We explored various methods to develop a 3D menu that is both visually appealing and mobile-friendly. After extensive brainstorming, we revamped the original menu styling by replacing the static image with a dynamic 3D image that runs smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Technologies 

We used HTML, Tailwind, and React + Vite to build our project.

Tailwind expedited the styling process of the site. We also included a calendar to display all events, highlighting the upcoming and main events in a dedicated section.
