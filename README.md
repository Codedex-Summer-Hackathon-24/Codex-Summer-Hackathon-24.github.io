## Description 

We designed and built Sip & Play a board game and cafe spot in NYC. We chose to focus on a mobile design for better user experience on the go.


## UI/UX

We worked to condense the website for better usability and to make the most out of packing the most information into a small screen while keeping it pretty. 

The home page was redesigned to help the user get an idea of what Sip & Play is about. We grouped the description and a link for making reservations at the top, we brought attention to the highlighted game events as well as bring Magic The Gathering to the forefront. 

We decided to use a carousal to show the highlighted game events to make it mobile friendly without losing interactivy. 

## 3D Menu

The 3D menu aspect of the project took a lot of brainstorming. It was a challenge to figure out the best way to include this so that it was able to run on a phone as well as look nice. We ultimately decided to revamp the original menu styling by replacing the still image with a beautiful 3D image instead instead. 

## Technologies 

We chose to use HTML, Tailwind, React + Vite to build our project. 

Tailwind helped to make the building styling aspect of the site faster we were able to include a calender that would show users all the events happening and highlight the upcoming/main events in one section.
