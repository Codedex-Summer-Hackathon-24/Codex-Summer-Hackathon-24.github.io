      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Founder, Jonathan Li, shares a passion for board games, boba, and
        delicious food, so he combined them all to become Sip & Play, Park
        Slope&apos's first board game cafe. It is a straightforward concept,
        come in with your friends and family to play any board game from our
        library of 300+ games! We hope when you visit, you also enjoy our
        coffee, espresso, boba, sandwiches, and snacks!
